# T-20_Cricket_game
Within this project, we have broken down our approach to implementing a realistic cricket game onto a Basys 3 FPGA board. Using Verilog, we created a pseudorandom number generator using an LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) and assigned probabilities to the outcomes in order to closely reflect a real cricket game. Through various logical elements, we have utilized components such as push buttons to take in user input and have developed a lifelike cricket scoreboard to keep track of things like number of runs, current ball count etc. You will find explanations on various aspects of digital design such as button debouncing, using a pseudorandom number generator, slowing a clock using a counter, converting data for seven-segment led display and of course how to tie them all together in order to form a functioning circuit. All code written for this project is refered in following files.
